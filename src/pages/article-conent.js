Now, URLparameters are generally used in React when we want a single component to be able to display multiple different pages, right? So for our article page, it s a single component, but we re going to want this to be able to displayall of the different articles in our application as if we had one page foreach article in our app. So what this means is that what we re going to need to do is take this article ID when we re inside our article page component and use that to load the data for the correct article thatmatches this ID.'
